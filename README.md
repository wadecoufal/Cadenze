With Cadenze, users can curate their collection in various ways: creating custom playlists, following their favorite artists, and saving songs and albums to their library. Users can also connect with friends by following their playlists.

The back-end of Cadenze was built using Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL, with image and song hosting on Amazon S3. The front-end was created with React and Redux, providing a smooth and dynamic user experience.
